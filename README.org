** Background

   
   This project was made to solve a huge problem we have in our world. How do
   we digitilize the trillions of physical documents that we have archived? Some
   of these archives include important information such as crimminal records,
   scientific studies, patient records, family history, etc. But unless we hired
   the whole world we would still need several genrations to complete this task.

   But the solution to this is machine learning, but to be more precise it's
   deep learning. Deep learning is based of what we know about neurological
   processing. In the brain we have many networks of neurons that produce an
   "output" or result. These results are then processed by other networks and so
   on. This is deep learning a model. The model is the brain and the layers are
   the neural networks.

** Problem[S]
   
   1. Messy
   2. Huge data size 
   3. Availability of Data
   4. Splitting data.
   
   It is very difficult for a human to learn to read and it's the same for
   computers. Let's face the facts, us humans are very messy and our
   handwritting reflect that. We have thousands of ways to write the same
   character or number.
   
   In this we will focus on letters since processing numbers has been succesfuly
   accomplished. But even without numbers this leaves us a huge dataset that our
   machine must learn from. We need thousands of examples for each letter to be
   able to correctly learn.

   Sure there are millions of documents and handwritting examples in the world but 
   to make these usable it would take a whole team to do. 

   To be able to read documents we must be able to break words into individual letters
   and then process those.

** Dataset

   https://www.nist.gov/itl/iad/image-group/emnist-dataset

   We will be using the EMNIST dataset which is a subset of the MNIST dataset. Spcifically we 
   will use the emnist-letters
